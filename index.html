            <h3>A girl with soft heart but anger issues</h3>

            <p>She has been a friend of mine since november 19th and the story goes on. There have been lots of fights
                and lots of dramas but that didn't affect our frindship or should I say she didn't let it happen because
                she is good at heart and full of smile. Do visit her profile it's a lifetime oppurtunity getting her
                facebook id. People are dying for just a glimpse of her.</p>
